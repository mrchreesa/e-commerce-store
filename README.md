    E-Commerce Store is a web application built with Next.js as full stack framework, Hygraph CMS as headless content management system and Stripe as payment system API. GraphQL is used as query language for fetching server-side props from the CMS. Fast user experience is ensured by server-side rendering by Next.js. After entering to the product list page, the user can see all available products provided by Hygraph. After selecting a product from the list, a product page is displayed with the corresponding URL. The user then can select the style of the product and the desired quantity, after that can add it to the cart. The updated cart component stays persistent if navigating to another page and is saved to LocalStorage. After finishing the order, the user can click on the checkout button and will navigated to Stripe checkout page where a transaction can take place. This web app is hosed on Vercel.
